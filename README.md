## Data Wrangling with Python (video edition)

Welcome to the code repository for [Data Wrangling with Python]()! If you have any questions reach out to @kjam on Twitter or GitHub.

### Code Structure

Most of the code covered in the videos is here; but not all of it. I highly recommend you take time to type out all the code along with the videos and simply use these scripts to "double check" or remind yourself of the work you've already completed.

### Data folder

Although I don't recommend keeping your data in a repository, I've done so here for the purpose of our shared use. In the data directory you'll find all of the examples used for the video series. You'll also find a copy of some example API responses and web pages in case these change after the video is available. If you find one of the scripts handling API or web data doesn't work, you can use the files here by accessing them via the File URI (normally file://file_name.html ).

### Corrections?

If you find any issues in these code examples, feel free to submit an Issue or Pull Request. I appreciate your input!

### Questions?
